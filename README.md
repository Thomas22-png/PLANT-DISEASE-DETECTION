This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting various plant diseases from leaf images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories. This tool can be useful for farmers, researchers, and agriculture enthusiasts to quickly identify plant diseases and take appropriate action.

Features
High Accuracy: Our model achieves high accuracy in detecting multiple plant diseases.
Easy to Use: The model can be easily used with pre-trained weights and a simple interface.
Extensible: Designed to be easily extendable for additional plant species and diseases.
